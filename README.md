# Untitled JBT Clone
WIP clone for jubeat written in CSharp using [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework).
Not remotely ready for any sort of use yet. Currently, entirely an experiment in learning to use Cursor
so all the code was written by Claude Sonnett 4. Very likely I take my learnings from what it wrote and
rewrite it myself but honestly it's interesting just how capable this tool has been so far...
